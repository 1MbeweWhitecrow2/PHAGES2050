# PHAGES2050
PHAGES2050 is a comprehensive AI-based framework for **phage research & therapy**.

A novel [Python programming language](https://python.org) framework to boost bacteriophage research and infrastructure in order to achieve the full potential to fight against antimicrobial resistant bacteria within **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning**.

Our project is about developing a framework for microbiologists and bioinformaticians who hunt, explore and classify phages. Applying the framework will shorten the duration of computational methods required to match phages with bacteria for specific patient cases. Having such organised framework at hand and freely-available will help develop personalized phage therapy and make it accessible to people worldwide.
